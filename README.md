# EE338 Filter Design

Most of the plots were created using codes written and executed on GNU Octave, running on a system with Ubuntu 20.04 as OS.
Apart from the default libraries, no other libraries are required.

It might be possible that the code gives an error when run in MATLAB.


However, the plots showing linear phase of FIR filters was written using MATLAB online, which has inbuilt support of toolboxes like 'Signal' required for some functions. These can be found in the MATLAB directory.
